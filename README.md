The C++ Starter is a [GitHub repository template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) that provides a minimalistic boilerplate to kickstart your [C++](https://isocpp.org) project. This template offers a streamlined foundation, complete with predefined file structures, essential tools, and recommended settings, ensuring a swift and efficient start to your C++ development journey.
