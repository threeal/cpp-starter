The C++ Starter is a [GitHub repository template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) that provides a minimalistic boilerplate to kickstart your [C++](https://isocpp.org) project. This template offers a streamlined foundation, complete with predefined file structures, essential tools, and recommended settings, ensuring a swift and efficient start to your C++ development journey.

## Key Features

- Utilizes [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as the build system generator.
- Integrates [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake/) for efficient package management.
- Incorporates [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) as the testing framework.
- Enforces consistent code formatting through [Format.cmake](https://github.com/TheLartians/Format.cmake).
- Implements static analysis by enabling warnings using [CheckWarning.cmake](https://github.com/threeal/CheckWarning.cmake/).
- Comes with a preconfigured [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow for continuous integration.
- Supports automatic dependency updates through [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) in GitHub Actions.
